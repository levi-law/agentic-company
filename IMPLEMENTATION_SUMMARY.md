## 🎯 Objective Completed
Implemented clickable task cards that navigate to a full-screen task detail view, providing users with comprehensive task information and management capabilities.

---

## ✅ What Was Built

### 1. **TaskScreen Component** (NEW)
**File**: `/workspace/src/app/components/TaskScreen.tsx` (365 lines)

A professional, full-screen task detail view featuring:

#### Header Section
- Large task title with animated status icon
- Color-coded department badge
- Status badge (PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, REVIEW, COMPLETED, BLOCKED)
- Priority badge (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
- "Back to Tasks" navigation button

#### Information Sections
- **Description**: Full task description in highlighted section
- **Details Grid** (2-column layout):
  - Assigned To (agent name)
  - Reviewed By (QA agent name)
  - Estimated Time (in hours)
  - Task ID (monospace font)
- **Dependencies**: List of prerequisite task IDs
- **Timeline**: Delegated, updated, and completed timestamps with calendar icons
- **Notes**: Additional task notes (when available)
- **Blockers**: Highlighted section showing blocking issues (when applicable)

#### Status Management
- **Status Update Buttons**: 5 clickable status options in a grid
- Current status is highlighted and disabled
- One-click status changes with visual feedback

#### Smart Action Buttons (Context-Aware)
- **Pending tasks**: "Run Task" button (blue)
- **In-progress tasks**: "Submit for Review" button (yellow)
- **Review tasks**: "Mark Complete" button (green)
- **Footer buttons**: "Close" and context-specific action

#### Visual Design
- Professional sections with borders and backgrounds
- Color-coded elements matching department and status
- Responsive grid layouts
- Icons from Radix UI for consistency
- Smooth hover effects and transitions

### 2. **TasksView Component** (UPDATED)
**File**: `/workspace/src/app/components/TasksView.tsx` (462 lines)

Enhanced the existing component with clickable functionality:

#### New Features
- **Clickable task cards**: Entire card is now clickable
- **Hover effects**: 
  - Enhanced shadow on hover
  - Blue border highlight on hover
  - Cursor changes to pointer
- **Click handler**: Prevents navigation when clicking action buttons
- **Visual hint**: Blue banner at bottom: "💡 Click on any task to view full details"
- **Removed**: Expand/collapse functionality (replaced with navigation)

#### Simplified UI
- Cleaner card design focused on essential information
- Better visual hierarchy
- Faster interaction (direct navigation vs expand/collapse)

---

### 3. **App.tsx Integration** (UPDATED)
**File**: `/workspace/src/app/App.tsx`

Added navigation logic and state management:

#### State Management
```typescript
const [selectedTask, setSelectedTask] = useState<any | null>(null);
```

#### Navigation Functions
- `handleTaskClick(task)`: Sets selected task and navigates to detail view
- `handleBackFromTask()`: Clears selected task and returns to list view
- `handleRunTask(taskId)`: Executes task (updates status to in_progress)
- `handleUpdateTaskStatus(taskId, status)`: Updates task status

#### Conditional Rendering
- **When selectedTask is null**: Shows normal 3-panel layout (Transcript | Tasks | Events)
- **When selectedTask exists**: Shows full-screen TaskScreen component
- Seamless transition between views

## 🎨 User Experience Flow

### List View → Detail View
1. User sees task list with filter options
2. User hovers over task → card shows shadow and blue border
3. User clicks anywhere on task card
4. Screen transitions to full-screen task detail view
5. User sees comprehensive task information

### Detail View → List View
1. User reviews task details
2. User clicks "Back to Tasks" button (top-left) OR "Close" button (bottom-left)
3. Screen transitions back to task list
4. Task list remains in same filter/scroll state

### Task Management Flow
1. **Pending Task** → Click "Run Task" → Status changes to "In Progress"
2. **In Progress** → Click "Submit for Review" → Status changes to "Review"
3. **Review** → Click "Mark Complete" → Status changes to "Completed"
4. **Any Status** → Click status button in grid → Direct status change

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Navigation Pattern
- Parent component (App) manages selected task state
- TasksView receives `onTaskClick` callback
- TaskScreen receives task data and action callbacks
- Clean separation of concerns

### Event Handling
- Click events bubble up to card container
- Button clicks are prevented from triggering navigation using `closest('button')` check
- Smooth state transitions without page reloads

### Styling Approach
- Tailwind CSS for all styling
- Consistent color palette across components
- Reusable color functions for status, priority, and department
- Responsive design principles

### Props Interface
```typescript
// TaskScreen props
interface TaskScreenProps {
  task: Task;
  onBack: () => void;
  onRunTask: (taskId: string) => void;
  onUpdateStatus: (taskId: string, status: Task["status"]) => void;
}

// TasksView props (updated)
interface TasksViewProps {
  isExpanded: boolean;
  onTaskClick?: (task: Task) => void; // NEW
}
```

write the overview again while keeping in mind this:
the goal of the app is to take the enterperneour to a fully working production app (not mvp, not poc, PRODUCTION! full scale).
The different agents in the system can be fully autoamted or semi automated, assiting human when needed. 
it covers all aspects, from setting up a company online, to terranform codes and cloud formation, with automated CI and CD into a working and tracked and monitored website. 


I would like to build an agent that allows the user to build a full business.
Prepare the full product page for my business, and I will take it to professional so he can build me the system. It should contain all the details needed to build a production ready app.
Agents with feedback look perform much better. For coding, feedback loop is probably passing full CI regression (sanity, integration, black box, full regression tests). For marketing, feedback look is probably the actual costs per action. Agent that just sends his work, probably have a code that is not fully working. There should be another QA agent that verifies the work. so couple our agents and design them in teams/groups such that each agent will have another agent that acts as feedback loop and approves the work.

The different agents in the system can be fully autoamted or semi automated, assiting human when needed. its comprised of 2 parts - planning & execution. the user and the AI together plan all the mission like a CEO. then then detail them to sub missions and sub tasks that needs to be done. then the agents or workers (can be human!) run and try to do what they can, while asking user's help on screens, captchas, logins, etc. it covers all aspects, from technical part to finance, business, legal, operations, marketing and sales. its a one stop place to run for example - on the tech side, it includes all from setting up code, github, to terranform codes and cloud formation, with automated CI and CD into a working and tracked and monitored website and tracked on ad/analytics platform. on the admistrative part - it helps the user (or automatically) create email accounts, ad accounts, social profiles etc etc for the business. on the marketing side it generates marketing content, creatives, runs the campaigns, etc etc. on the sales, it creates sales campaigns, creatives, etc etc. and so on and on (gpt - fill here many more examples) .

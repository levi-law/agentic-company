# Tasks View Implementation

## Overview
I've implemented a functional tasks view for the Business-Builder Agent platform that allows users to see their open tasks, view their state, and run/play them.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. TasksView Component (`src/app/components/TasksView.tsx`)
A new React component that displays tasks with the following features:

- **Task Display**: Shows all tasks with their details including:
  - Title and description
  - Department (Technical, Marketing, Sales, Legal, Finance, Operations, HR)
  - Status (pending, in_progress, review, completed, blocked)
  - Priority (low, medium, high, critical)
  - Estimated hours
  - Assigned agent and reviewer

- **Filtering**: 
  - Filter by department
  - Filter by status

- **Statistics Dashboard**: 
  - Total tasks
  - Pending tasks
  - Active (in progress) tasks
  - Completed tasks
  - Blocked tasks

- **Task Actions**:
  - Click to expand/collapse task details
  - "Run Task" button for pending tasks (changes status to in_progress)
  - Visual indicators for different task states
  - Color-coded badges for department, status, and priority

- **Visual Design**:
  - Clean, modern UI with Tailwind CSS
  - Color-coded status icons (âœ“ for completed, spinning icon for in progress, etc.)
  - Responsive layout that fits alongside the transcript and logs
  - Hover effects and smooth transitions

### 2. Integration with Main App
- Added tasks view toggle to the bottom toolbar (checkbox next to Logs)
- Tasks view appears between the Transcript and Events/Logs panels
- State persists in localStorage (remembers if tasks view is open/closed)
- Fixed width (96rem) panel that can be toggled on/off

### 3. UI/UX Features
- Expandable task cards showing detailed information
- Status-based action buttons (Run Task, In Progress, Completed indicators)
- Real-time task filtering without page reloads
- Refresh button to reload tasks
- Empty state message when no tasks are found

## Architecture Integration

### Data Flow
The current implementation uses mock data for demonstration. In production, this would integrate with:
- CEO Agent's `generateTasks` tool (from `/src/app/agentConfigs/businessBuilder/ceoTools.ts`)
- CEO Agent's `getTaskStatus` tool for real-time updates
- CEO Agent's `updateTaskProgress` tool when running tasks
- The shared context system for business-specific task information

### Mock Data
Currently shows 10 sample tasks across all 7 departments:
- Technical: 3 tasks (Repository Setup, Architecture Design, Core Development)
- Marketing: 2 tasks (Brand Identity, Website Content)
- Sales: 1 task (CRM Setup)
- Legal: 1 task (Business Entity Formation)
- Finance: 1 task (Banking Setup)
- Operations: 1 task (SOPs)
- HR: 1 task (Employee Handbook)

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:
- `/workspace/src/app/components/TasksView.tsx` - Main tasks view component

### Modified:
- `/workspace/src/app/App.tsx` - Integrated TasksView component
- `/workspace/src/app/components/BottomToolbar.tsx` - Added tasks toggle checkbox
- `/workspace/src/app/globals.css` - Added spin-slow animation for in-progress tasks

## How to Use

1. **Start the app**: The tasks view is enabled by default
2. **Toggle visibility**: Use the "Tasks" checkbox in the bottom toolbar
3. **Filter tasks**: Use the dropdown menus to filter by department or status
4. **View details**: Click on any task card to expand and see full details
5. **Run a task**: Click the "Run Task" button on pending tasks to change their status to in_progress
6. **Refresh**: Click the refresh icon in the tasks panel header to reload tasks

## Future Enhancements

To connect this to real task data:

1. **API Integration**: Create API endpoints that call the CEO Agent's task management tools
2. **Real-time Updates**: Use WebSocket or polling to keep task status in sync
3. **Task Creation**: Allow users to create tasks directly from the UI
4. **Task Editing**: Enable editing task details, priorities, and assignments
5. **Progress Tracking**: Show progress bars for partially completed tasks
6. **Dependencies Visualization**: Display task dependency graphs
7. **Agent Assignment**: Allow reassigning tasks to different agents
8. **Notifications**: Alert users when tasks complete or get blocked
9. **Task History**: Show audit log of task status changes
10. **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple tasks for batch operations

## Design Philosophy

The tasks view follows the existing design patterns in the Business-Builder platform:
- Consistent with the Transcript and Events panels
- Uses the same Tailwind CSS styling approach
- Matches the color scheme and typography
- Responsive and accessible
- Clean, professional interface suitable for business use

## Technical Notes

- Built with React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Radix UI icons for consistent icon set
- Follows Next.js app directory structure
- Integrates seamlessly with existing context providers

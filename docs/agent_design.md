## Feedback Loop Implementation

The feedback loop system uses LangGraph's state machine to ensure quality and prevent infinite loops:

### State Management
- **Task State**: Current task, attempt count, deliverables, QA reports
- **Quality Metrics**: Test results, performance data, compliance status
- **Escalation Triggers**: Failed attempts, timeout conditions, complexity thresholds

### Execution Flow
1. **Producer Node**: Agent executes task using specialized tools and integrations
2. **Validation Node**: QA agent runs objective evaluations (tests, metrics, compliance checks)
3. **Decision Node**: Determines if quality gates are met or feedback is needed
4. **Feedback Node**: Generates specific, actionable improvement recommendations
5. **Iteration Control**: Routes back to producer or escalates based on attempt limits

### Quality Assurance Process
- **Objective Metrics Only**: No self‑assessment; only measurable criteria determine success
- **Automated Testing**: CI/CD pipelines, performance benchmarks, compliance scans
- **Real‑World Validation**: Live testing, user feedback, market performance data
- **Continuous Improvement**: Feedback loops inform agent training and process optimization

## Human‑in‑the‑Loop Integration

The system requires human approval for critical business decisions while maintaining automation for routine tasks:

- **Brand Decisions**: Logo selection, brand voice approval, creative direction
- **Product Direction**: Feature prioritization, user experience decisions, pricing strategy
- **Market Strategy**: Target market selection, positioning decisions, partnership approvals
- **Quality Gates**: Final approval on major deliverables before implementation

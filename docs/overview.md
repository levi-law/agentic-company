# Project Overview

## Purpose and Vision

The **Business‑Builder Agent** is a comprehensive AI‑powered platform that transforms entrepreneurial ideas into fully operational, production‑ready businesses. Not MVP. Not POC. **PRODUCTION**—complete business infrastructure across technical, financial, legal, operational, marketing, and sales domains.

The platform operates in two phases:
1. **Planning Phase**: CEO‑level strategic planning with human‑AI collaboration
2. **Execution Phase**: Autonomous agent teams with human assistance for authentication, approvals, and complex decisions

Every agent is paired with a QA/Review agent, creating feedback loops that ensure production‑quality deliverables across all business functions.

## Agent Team Architecture with Feedback Loops

Every production agent is paired with a QA/Review agent to ensure quality:

### Technical Development Team
- **Developer Agent** + **Code Review Agent**: Code must pass full CI regression (unit, integration, black‑box, full regression tests) before deployment

### Marketing Team
- **Marketing Agent** + **Performance Analytics Agent**: Campaigns optimized based on actual cost‑per‑action and conversion metrics

### Sales Team
- **Sales Agent** + **Sales Performance Agent**: Strategies refined based on conversion rates and customer acquisition costs

### Legal & Compliance Team
- **Legal Agent** + **Compliance Review Agent**: All legal documents must pass regulatory compliance review

### Finance & Accounting Team
- **Finance Agent** + **Financial Audit Agent**: Financial records must reconcile and meet audit standards

### Operations Team
- **Operations Agent** + **Quality Assurance Agent**: Operational processes must meet quality benchmarks

### HR Team
- **HR Agent** + **HR Compliance Agent**: HR processes must meet legal and company standards

## Two‑Phase Operation Model

### Phase 1: Strategic Planning (CEO Mode)
**Human‑AI Collaborative Planning**

### Phase 2: Execution (Agent Workforce)
**Autonomous Execution with Human Assistance**
Agents execute planned tasks with human support for:
- Authentication (logins, 2FA, captchas)
- High‑impact approvals (spending, contracts, launches)
- Complex interactions (negotiations, creative reviews)
- Quality gate approvals

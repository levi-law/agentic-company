# Quick Start - Testing the Session Fix

## 🚀 Quick Verification (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Start the Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Open Browser DevTools
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Press `F12` or `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)
3. Go to **Console** tab

### Step 3: Clear State
```javascript
// In browser console, run:
localStorage.clear()
```

### Step 4: Refresh and Watch Logs

**First Refresh:**
```
✅ Expected in console:
[Session] Creating new session...
[Session] Created new session: <some-id> (anonymous)

✅ Expected in terminal:
prisma:query INSERT INTO "public"."Session" ... (ONCE)
```

**Second Refresh (Cmd+R):**
```
✅ Expected in console:
[Session] Restored session from localStorage: <same-id>

✅ Expected in terminal:
NO prisma:query INSERT (just a SELECT to validate)
```

**Third, Fourth, Fifth Refresh:**
```
✅ Expected:
Same as second refresh - restores from localStorage
NO new sessions created
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

| Test | Before Fix | After Fix |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| First page load | 1-2 sessions created | 1 session created ✅ |
| Second refresh | 1-2 MORE sessions | SAME session restored ✅ |
| 10 rapid refreshes | 10-20 sessions | 1 session total ✅ |
| Session ID changes | Every refresh ❌ | Never changes ✅ |

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ GOOD Signs (Fix Working)
- Console shows: `[Session] Restored session from localStorage`
- Same session ID across refreshes
- Terminal shows: NO repeated `INSERT INTO "public"."Session"`
- Fast page loads

### ❌ BAD Signs (Fix Not Working)
- Console shows: `[Session] Creating new session...` on EVERY refresh
- Different session ID each time
- Terminal shows: Repeated `INSERT INTO "public"."Session"`
- Slow page loads

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Still creating duplicate sessions

**Solution 1: Hard Refresh**
```bash
# In browser:
Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
```

**Solution 2: Clear Everything**
```javascript
// In browser console:
localStorage.clear()
sessionStorage.clear()
location.reload(true)
```

**Solution 3: Verify Code Changes**
```bash
# In terminal:
git log --oneline -1
# Should show: "fix: prevent duplicate session creation..."
```

### Problem: localStorage not working

**Check:**
```javascript
// In browser console:
localStorage.setItem('test', '123')
localStorage.getItem('test') // Should return '123'
```

If this fails, check browser privacy settings.

## 📊 Database Verification

### Check Session Count
```bash
# Connect to your database and run:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Session" 
WHERE "createdAt" > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```

**Expected:**
- Before fix: Grows rapidly (10+ per minute of testing)
- After fix: Minimal growth (1-2 per session)

### View Recent Sessions
```sql
SELECT id, "agentConfig", status, "createdAt"
FROM "Session"
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Expected:**
- Should NOT see rapid creation of new sessions
- Should see same session ID being reused

## 🎯 Advanced Testing

### Test 1: React Strict Mode
```bash
# Verify Strict Mode is enabled (default in Next.js)
# Refresh page multiple times
# Should still only create ONE session
```

### Test 2: Multiple Tabs
```bash
# Open same URL in 2 tabs
# Both should share the same session (via localStorage)
# Check console in both tabs - should show same session ID
```

### Test 3: Login Flow
```bash
# 1. Load page as anonymous → creates session
# 2. Login → SAME session, now linked to user
# 3. Check database → userId field populated, no new session
```

## 📈 Performance Comparison

### Measure Database Load

**Before Fix:**
```bash
# Watch database queries for 1 minute while refreshing
# Count INSERT statements
# Expected: 10-20+ INSERTs
```

**After Fix:**
```bash
# Watch database queries for 1 minute while refreshing
# Count INSERT statements
# Expected: 1 INSERT (first load only)
```

### Measure Page Load Speed

**Before Fix:**
- First load: ~3s (creates session)
- Subsequent: ~3s (creates NEW session each time)

**After Fix:**
- First load: ~3s (creates session)
- Subsequent: ~0.5s (restores from localStorage)

## 📝 Reporting Results

### If Fix Works ✅
```
✅ Session persistence working correctly
✅ Only 1 session created on first load
✅ Same session restored on refresh
✅ No database bloat
✅ Fast page loads

Ready for production deployment.
```

### If Fix Doesn't Work ❌
```
Please provide:
1. Browser console logs (full output)
2. Terminal logs (npm run dev output)
3. Database session count
4. Steps to reproduce
5. Browser and OS version
```

## 🚢 Next Steps

Once verified:
1. ✅ Test in staging environment
2. ✅ Monitor production metrics
3. ✅ Deploy to production
4. ✅ Add automated tests

# Business-Builder Agent: Usage Guide

## Overview

The Business-Builder Agent is a comprehensive AI-powered platform that transforms entrepreneurial ideas into fully operational, production-ready businesses. This guide explains how to use the platform effectively.

## Getting Started

### 1. Launch the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### 2. Select the Business Builder Scenario

- In the top-right corner, select **"businessBuilder"** from the Scenario dropdown
- The default agent will be **"CEO"**
- Click **"Connect"** to start the session

### 3. Begin Your Business Planning Session

The CEO Agent will greet you and ask about your business idea. This begins the **Planning Phase**.

## Two-Phase Operation Model

### Phase 1: Strategic Planning (CEO Mode)

The CEO Agent guides you through comprehensive business planning:

#### Step 1: Business Discovery

The CEO Agent will ask questions to understand:
- Your business idea and vision
- Target market and customer segments
- Value proposition
- Revenue model
- Timeline and budget constraints
- Key success metrics

**Example Conversation:**
```
CEO: "Hello! I'm your CEO Agent. I'm here to help you build a complete, 
production-ready business. Tell me about your business idea."

You: "I want to create a SaaS platform for project management aimed at 
small design agencies."

CEO: "Excellent! Let me ask a few questions to understand your vision better. 
Who is your target customer?"

You: "Small design agencies with 5-20 employees who need better project 
tracking and client communication."

CEO: "Great. What's your revenue model?"

You: "Monthly subscription, starting at $49/month per team."
```

#### Step 2: Business Plan Generation

Once the CEO Agent has enough information, it will use the `generateBusinessPlan` tool to create a comprehensive plan covering:

- **Technical Development**: Application, infrastructure, CI/CD, monitoring
- **Marketing**: Brand development, content, SEO/SEM, campaigns
- **Sales**: CRM, funnels, lead generation, proposals
- **Legal**: Entity formation, contracts, compliance, IP protection
- **Finance**: Banking, accounting, invoicing, reporting
- **Operations**: SOPs, customer support, vendor management
- **HR**: Recruitment, policies, payroll, performance management

The plan includes estimated timelines and priorities for each area.

#### Step 3: Task Generation

The CEO Agent will use the `generateTasks` tool to create detailed tasks across all departments. Each task includes:
- Task ID and title
- Department and assigned agents
- Priority level
- Estimated effort (hours)
- Dependencies
- Status tracking

**Example Output:**
```
CEO: "I've generated 32 detailed tasks across all departments:
- Technical Development: 6 tasks (120 hours)
- Marketing: 5 tasks (126 hours)
- Sales: 4 tasks (78 hours)
- Legal: 4 tasks (56 hours)
- Finance: 4 tasks (56 hours)
- Operations: 3 tasks (60 hours)
- HR: 3 tasks (52 hours)

Total estimated effort: 548 hours over approximately 90 days."
```

#### Step 4: Approval Request

Before moving to execution, the CEO Agent will request your approval using the `requestApproval` tool:

```
CEO: "I've created a comprehensive business plan and task list. This is a 
high-impact strategic decision. Would you like to review and approve the 
plan before we proceed to execution?"
```

**Your Response Options:**
- **Approve**: "Yes, let's proceed with the plan."
- **Request Changes**: "Can we adjust the timeline for marketing?"
- **Ask Questions**: "What's the estimated cost for the technical infrastructure?"

### Phase 2: Execution (Agent Workforce)

Once you approve the plan, the CEO Agent delegates tasks to specialized department teams.

#### Team Structure

Each department has a **Producer Agent** paired with a **QA/Review Agent**:

1. **Technical Development Team**
   - **Developer Agent**: Builds production-ready technical infrastructure
   - **Code Review Agent**: Validates code quality, runs tests, security scans

2. **Marketing Team**
   - **Marketing Agent**: Creates marketing infrastructure and campaigns
   - **Performance Analytics Agent**: Monitors metrics, optimizes campaigns

3. **Sales Team**
   - **Sales Agent**: Builds sales infrastructure and processes
   - **Sales Performance Agent**: Tracks conversion rates, optimizes funnels

4. **Legal & Compliance Team**
   - **Legal Agent**: Handles legal matters and documentation
   - **Compliance Review Agent**: Validates regulatory compliance

5. **Finance & Accounting Team**
   - **Finance Agent**: Manages financial operations
   - **Financial Audit Agent**: Validates financial accuracy

6. **Operations Team**
   - **Operations Agent**: Ensures operational excellence
   - **Quality Assurance Agent**: Validates operational quality

7. **HR Team**
   - **HR Agent**: Manages human resources operations
   - **HR Compliance Agent**: Ensures HR legal compliance

#### Task Delegation

The CEO Agent uses the `delegateToTeam` tool to assign tasks:

```
CEO: "I'm now delegating tasks to our specialized teams. Let's start with 
the critical path items:

1. Delegating legal entity formation to the Legal team
2. Delegating repository setup to the Technical team
3. Delegating brand identity to the Marketing team

Each team has a Producer and QA agent to ensure quality."
```

#### Progress Monitoring

You can ask the CEO Agent for status updates at any time:

**You:** "What's the status of the technical development tasks?"

**CEO Agent** (uses `getTaskStatus` tool):
```
"Here's the current status of Technical Development:
- Repository Setup: Completed ✓
- Application Architecture: In Progress (60% complete)
- Core Application Development: Pending
- Infrastructure as Code: Pending
- Security Implementation: Pending
- Monitoring Setup: Pending

The Developer and Code Review agents are working on the architecture design."
```

#### Quality Assurance Feedback Loops

Each Producer agent works with their paired QA agent:

**Example: Technical Development**
1. Developer Agent writes code
2. Code Review Agent runs full CI regression tests
3. If tests pass → Code approved, move to next task
4. If tests fail → Code Review Agent provides specific feedback
5. Developer Agent fixes issues and resubmits
6. Cycle repeats until production quality is achieved

#### Human Assistance Points

The CEO Agent will request your assistance for:

1. **Authentication**: Login credentials, 2FA, captchas for external services
2. **High-Impact Approvals**: Significant spending, contracts, major decisions
3. **Complex Interactions**: Creative reviews, strategic pivots
4. **Quality Gate Approvals**: Final approval on major deliverables

**Example:**
```
CEO: "The Legal team has completed the business entity formation documents. 
This is a critical milestone requiring your approval. The estimated cost is 
$500 for filing fees. Would you like to review and approve?"
```

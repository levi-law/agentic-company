# System Architecture

The Business-Builder Agent Platform builds on OpenAI's Realtime Agents foundation to create a comprehensive business development system. The human user acts as CEO of a dynamic virtual organization, working through voice and text conversations with specialized agent teams that execute business development tasks across all departments—from initial planning through live operations and continuous improvement.

## Foundation: OpenAI Realtime Agents

We extend the proven OpenAI Realtime Agents architecture rather than building from scratch:

- **Next.js Application**: Modern React framework with TypeScript
- **OpenAI Realtime API**: Low-latency voice and text interactions  
- **Agent Framework**: Built-in agent orchestration and handoffs
- **WebRTC Integration**: Real-time audio/video communication
- **Tool Integration**: Extensible function calling system

## Extended Platform Components

Building on the OpenAI Realtime Agents foundation:

| Component | Description | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| **Business CEO Agent** | Strategic business planning agent that orchestrates department teams | Extended RealtimeAgent with business-specific instructions and handoffs |
| **Department Agent Teams** | Specialized Producer + QA agent pairs for each business function | Multiple RealtimeAgent configurations with feedback loop tools |
| **Task Generation System** | AI-powered business task creation from strategic conversations | Custom tools integrated into the existing function calling system |
| **Quality Gate Framework** | Producer + QA validation cycles with objective metrics | Extended tool logic with validation workflows |
| **Business Integration Hub** | Connections to business APIs (Stripe, QuickBooks, GitHub, etc.) | Additional API integrations using the existing tool pattern |
| **Progress Tracking Dashboard** | Real-time visibility into business development progress | Enhanced UI components built on the existing Next.js foundation |
| **Approval Workflow System** | Human oversight for high-impact business decisions | Extended conversation flows with approval gates |

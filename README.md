# Business-Builder Agent Platform

Building production-ready businesses through AI-powered agent teams, starting with OpenAI's Realtime Agents foundation.

## Quick Start

We're building on OpenAI's Realtime Agents demo as our foundation, extending it to create comprehensive business-building capabilities.

### Architecture Overview

**Foundation**: OpenAI Realtime Agents (Next.js + TypeScript + OpenAI Realtime API)  
**Extensions**: Business agent configs, task management, multi-agent workflows

### Current Implementation

#### **OpenAI Realtime Agents Foundation**
- **Next.js Application**: Modern React framework with TypeScript
- **OpenAI Realtime API**: Low-latency voice and text interactions
- **Agent Framework**: Built-in agent orchestration and handoffs
- **WebRTC Integration**: Real-time audio/video communication
- **Multiple Agent Patterns**: Chat-Supervisor and Sequential Handoff examples

#### **Business-Builder Extensions** (To Be Added)
- **CEO Conversation Agent**: Strategic planning and business development
- **Task Generation System**: AI-powered business task creation
- **Multi-Department Agents**: Technical, Marketing, Sales, Legal, Finance, Operations, HR
- **Quality Gates**: Producer + QA agent pairs with feedback loops
- **Business Templates**: Industry-specific agent configurations

## Setup Instructions

### 1. OpenAI Realtime Agents Setup

```bash
cd openai-realtime-agents

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.sample .env
# Edit .env with your OpenAI API key

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Access the Platform

- **Application**: http://localhost:3000
- **Default Agent**: Chat Supervisor pattern
- **Switch Scenarios**: Use dropdown to try different agent patterns

## How It Works

### Current: OpenAI Realtime Agents Demo

1. **User connects** to the realtime interface
2. **Speaks or types** their request
3. **Agent responds** in real-time with voice and text
4. **Agent handoffs** transfer between specialized agents
5. **Tools and functions** execute specific tasks

### Planned: Business-Builder Extensions

- **CEO Agent**: Strategic business planning and oversight
- **Department Agents**: Specialized teams for each business function
- **Task Generation**: Automatic business task creation and assignment
- **Quality Loops**: Producer + QA agent validation cycles
- **Business Templates**: Pre-configured agent teams for different industries

### Example Business Conversation (Planned)

```
CEO: "I want to start an e-commerce business selling sustainable products"

Business Agent: "I'll help you build this business. Let me gather some information:
- What's your target market and budget?
- Do you have supplier relationships?
- What's your timeline for launch?"

CEO: "Targeting millennials, $50K budget, 3-month timeline"

Business Agent: "Perfect! I'm assembling specialized teams:
✓ Legal Team: Business registration, contracts
✓ Technical Team: Website, payments, inventory system
✓ Marketing Team: Brand development, SEO, campaigns
✓ Operations Team: Fulfillment, customer support
✓ Finance Team: Accounting setup, pricing strategy

Each team has Producer + QA agents for quality assurance.
Estimated timeline: 8-12 weeks to launch. Ready to proceed?"
```

## Technical Implementation

### OpenAI Realtime Agents Foundation

```typescript
// Business agent configuration extending the base pattern
export const businessBuilderAgent = new RealtimeAgent({
  name: 'businessBuilder',
  handoffDescription: 'Comprehensive business development agent',
  instructions: `You are a CEO-level business development agent that helps entrepreneurs 
    build complete, production-ready businesses. You work with specialized department 
    agents and ensure quality through producer + QA agent pairs.`,
  tools: [/* business-specific tools */],
  handoffs: [legalAgent, technicalAgent, marketingAgent, /* ... */]
});
```

### Agent Team Structure

```typescript
// Each department has Producer + QA agent pairs
const technicalTeam = {
  producer: new RealtimeAgent({ name: 'developer', /* ... */ }),
  qa: new RealtimeAgent({ name: 'codeReviewer', /* ... */ })
};

const marketingTeam = {
  producer: new RealtimeAgent({ name: 'marketer', /* ... */ }),
  qa: new RealtimeAgent({ name: 'performanceAnalyst', /* ... */ })
};
```

### Business Task Generation

```typescript
// Extend the existing tool system for business tasks
const generateBusinessTasks = {
  name: 'generate_business_tasks',
  description: 'Generate comprehensive business development tasks',
  parameters: { /* task generation schema */ }
};
```

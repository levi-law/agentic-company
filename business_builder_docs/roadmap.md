# Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the major milestones for delivering the Business‑Builder Agent platform.  Timelines are illustrative; adjust according to team capacity and feedback cycles.

## Phase 1 – Foundation (Weeks 1–3)

1. **Repository and CI setup** – Create GitHub repository, configure branching strategy, set up GitHub Actions for linting, tests and deployment.  Define coding standards and commit message guidelines.
2. **Infrastructure provisioning** – Create GCP project, set up service accounts, enable required APIs, and configure Secret Manager.  Provision initial Cloud Run services for the backend and orchestrator.
3. **Backend scaffolding** – Implement FastAPI server with endpoints for authentication, project creation and chat messaging.  Integrate the LangChain/LangGraph orchestrator skeleton with a dummy agent.  Set up Postgres and vector database.
4. **Mobile MVP** – Scaffold React Native app with screens for sign‑in, project list and chat.  Implement API client for backend communication.

## Phase 2 – Core Agent Functions (Weeks 4–6)

1. **Planning agent** – Build the planning agent to decompose business goals into tasks.  Implement the contract schema and store plans in the database.
2. **Research module** – Integrate a search tool (SerpAPI or Tavily).  Create researcher and research‑QA agents.  Implement citation checks and store knowledge chunks in the vector database.
3. **Financial module** – Implement financial model generator using Pandas; generate CSV and charts.  Create finance QA agent to validate financial models.  Enforce unit‑economics checks.
4. **Branding module** – Generate name suggestions and style guides.  Optionally integrate an image‑generation API for logos.  Include QA checks for name conflicts and domain availability.
5. **Marketing module** – Draft ICP definitions, messaging and campaign plans.  Implement marketing QA to validate experiment design and tracking configuration.

## Phase 3 – Product & Deployment (Weeks 7–9)

1. **Product scaffolding** – Build code generation tools to scaffold a web/app (e.g. Next.js backend with API routes).  Integrate with GitHub to push code to a repository branch.
2. **QA & Testing** – Integrate CI tests into the code generation process.  The QA agent should ensure generated projects build successfully and meet coverage and static analysis thresholds.
3. **Preview deploy** – Deploy generated applications to a preview environment (Vercel, Netlify or Cloud Run).  Provide links for user review.  Add approval step before promotion to production.
4. **Human‑in‑the‑loop UI** – Expand the mobile app to include task boards, approval dialogs and artefact viewers.

## Phase 4 – Operations & Analytics (Weeks 10–12)

1. **Operations module** – Recommend tools for CRM, support and analytics.  Generate standard operating procedures (SOP) templates.  Provide checklists for team onboarding.
2. **Analytics and metrics** – Collect system metrics (task duration, cost, token usage) and user‑journey analytics.  Implement dashboards for monitoring agent performance.
3. **Marketing execution** – Integrate with email or ad APIs (subject to user approval).  Implement feedback loops to adjust campaigns based on metrics (CPA, CTR)【261370890818637†L431-L475】.
4. **Security review** – Audit IAM roles, service account usage and secret management.  Run penetration tests and fix vulnerabilities.

## Phase 5 – Refinement and Scaling (Weeks 13+)

1. **User testing & iteration** – Run usability tests with entrepreneurs.  Collect feedback on workflow clarity, agent suggestions and approval experience.  Iterate on prompts and UI.
2. **Multi‑agent collaboration** – Add support for teams of agents working in parallel (vertical and horizontal patterns) and consensus mechanisms【771092070292935†L60-L76】.
3. **Framework evaluation** – Periodically reassess agent frameworks.  Evaluate alternatives like CrewAI and Semantic Kernel for specific modules and integrate where beneficial.
4. **Enterprise readiness** – Add features needed for larger organisations: role‑based access control, audit exports, single sign‑on, multi‑tenant workspaces and SLA monitoring.
5. **Continuous improvement** – Use evaluation techniques and cost‑tracking to optimise prompts and workflows.  Monitor token usage, execution latency and success rates.  Add new tools as the ecosystem evolves.

This roadmap provides a structured path from MVP to a production‑ready platform.  Adjust scope and timing based on user feedback and evolving technology landscapes.

# Project Overview

## Purpose and Vision

The **Business‑Builder Agent** is an AI‑assisted platform that helps entrepreneurs turn a business idea into a production‑ready venture.  It uses large‑language‑model (LLM) agents to perform research, build financial models, generate branding assets, scaffold code, and design go‑to‑market strategies, while keeping the user in control through mandatory checkpoints and approvals.

Agentic AI adoption is rapidly growing.  A 2025 enterprise report found that **61 % of organizations were already experimenting with agentic AI**, and analysts predict that **33 % of enterprise software will contain agentic AI by 2028**【747994860962326†L101-L113】.  Yet the same study warns that **40 % of projects may be canceled** due to high costs, unclear value or poor risk controls【747994860962326†L101-L113】.  This context underscores the need for a well‑planned, reliable system rather than a quick prototype.

## High‑Level Goals

- **End‑to‑end business creation**: Provide tools for market research, competitive analysis, regulatory guidance, financial modelling, branding, product scaffolding, marketing, and operations.
- **Agent teams with quality feedback loops**: Each producing agent (researcher, developer, marketer, etc.) is paired with a reviewer agent that validates work against objective criteria (tests, metrics, citations) and either approves or returns actionable fixes.
- **User‑controlled approvals**: High‑impact actions (naming, domain purchase, public deployment, paid advertising) always require explicit user approval.
- **Scalable and secure architecture**: Build on GitHub for version control and CI, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for hosting and storage, Python for backend logic and agent orchestration, and React Native for cross‑platform mobile experiences.  Follow least‑privilege practices for service accounts and protect data with encryption and secrets management.

## Why Agentic AI?

Agentic systems are attractive because they can decide which tools to use, execute multi‑step workflows and learn from feedback.  However, building reliable agents requires careful control over context and execution.  LangChain’s new agent abstraction makes this explicit: an agent calls an LLM with some input; if the LLM decides to call a tool, the agent executes the tool and returns the result; this loop continues until the LLM stops calling tools【797340751249754†L48-L56】.  Frameworks like LangGraph provide durable execution, short‑term memory and human‑in‑the‑loop patterns【797340751249754†L29-L35】, while LangChain 1.0 introduces a **`create_agent`** helper built on LangGraph to simplify agent creation【797340751249754†L61-L66】.  Our platform leverages these capabilities to orchestrate complex, feedback‑driven workflows.

## Market Context

There is now a rich ecosystem of agentic frameworks.  LangGraph specialises in graph‑based orchestration with state tracking, node caching and deferred execution【771092070292935†L60-L76】.  CrewAI offers a role‑based, rapid‑prototyping approach【261370890818637†L321-L340】.  OpenAI Swarm provides a lightweight framework for experimental multi‑agent systems【261370890818637†L343-L359】.  Semantic Kernel focuses on enterprise .NET integration and security【261370890818637†L361-L377】.  When choosing a framework, consider the complexity of your workflow, your team’s expertise, infrastructure requirements and existing integrations【261370890818637†L406-L418】.  We select LangChain/LangGraph for their mature ecosystem, powerful orchestration and extensive integrations, while remaining open to specialised tools for specific modules.
